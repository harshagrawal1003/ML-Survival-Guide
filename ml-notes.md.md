Artificial Intelligence (AI)  
Artificial Intelligence is the science and engineering of creating machines that can perform tasks which normally require human intelligence. These tasks include decision-making, problem-solving, learning, understanding language, and visual recognition.




Types of AI


1. Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI)  

Also called Weak AI, ANI is designed to perform a single specific task very efficiently. It cannot perform tasks outside its predefined function.  
Example: Voice assistants like Siri or Alexa, language translation tools like Google Translate.


2. Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) 

Also known as Strong AI, AGI has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks, similar to human intelligence. It is still under development and has not been fully achieved.  
Example: A theoretical AI system that could reason like a human across any domain.

3. Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI) 

ASI is a future concept where machines will be more intelligent than humans in every aspect â€” creativity, logic, emotion, and social intelligence. It remains purely theoretical at present.  
Example: Not yet developed, often discussed in science fiction and future research.




Domains of AI


Machine Learning  

A branch of AI where machines learn from data and improve their performance over time without being explicitly programmed for each task. It focuses on algorithms that can learn patterns and make predictions or decisions.

Fuzzy Logic  

A mathematical logic that handles the concept of partial truth, used when the information is imprecise or uncertain. Unlike binary logic (0 or 1), fuzzy logic allows values between 0 and 1.  
Example: Used in automatic climate control systems and washing machines.

Robotics  

An interdisciplinary domain that involves the design, construction, operation, and use of robots. In AI, robotics focuses on giving robots the ability to perceive their environment, make decisions, and perform tasks autonomously.  
Example: Industrial robots, autonomous drones.

Deep Learning  

A subset of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers. It is capable of learning from large amounts of unstructured data like images, audio, and text.  
Example: Facial recognition systems, self-driving cars.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)

NLP is a field of AI that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language. It enables machines to read, understand, and generate human language.  
Example: Chatbots, speech recognition, translation tools.





Machine Learning Types



Supervised Learning  

In supervised learning, the algorithm is trained on a dataset that includes input-output pairs. The model learns to map inputs to the correct output.  
Example: Predicting house prices based on features like size and location.

Unsupervised Learning 

Unsupervised learning involves training on data without labeled outputs. The goal is to find hidden patterns or groupings in the data.  
Example: Customer segmentation based on purchasing behavior.

Semi-Supervised Learning  

This technique uses a small amount of labeled data combined with a large amount of unlabeled data. It lies between supervised and unsupervised learning.  
Example: Classifying web pages when only a few pages are labeled.

Reinforcement Learning  

In reinforcement learning, an agent learns by interacting with its environment and receiving rewards or penalties based on its actions. It focuses on maximizing the total reward over time.  
Example: AI playing chess or controlling a robotic arm.
